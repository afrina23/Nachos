# Nachos
Nachos is an instructional software, an attempt to study and modify an operating system.
But there is a difference between Nachos and a real operating system. Nachos runs as a
single Unix user process whereas real operating systems run on bare machines. However,
Nachos simulates the general low level facilities of typical machines including interrupts,
vm and interrupt driven device IO.
